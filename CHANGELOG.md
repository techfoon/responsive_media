### âœ¨ Summary
This release focuses on improving responsiveness with dynamic breakpoints, typography, and shorthand extensions for responsive values.

### ðŸš€ New Features
- **Dynamic Breakpoints**:
  - Introduced breakpoints (`XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`) for responsive scaling.
  - Sizes dynamically adjust based on `shortestSide` and `screenWidth`.
- **Long Side Support**:
  - Added `longestSide` for responsive calculations in landscape and large screens.
- **Custom Gap Widgets**:
  - Added a `gap()` method that accepts custom widgets or sizes.
  - Predefined gaps like `gapXS()`, `gapS()`, `gapM()`, `gapL()`, and `gapXL()` are still available.
- **Responsive Typography**:
  - Added fully dynamic typography text styles for `h1` to `h6`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`, `caption`, `button`, and `overline`.
  - Sizes are now dynamically calculated using `shortestSide` and breakpoints.
- **Shorthand Extensions**:
  - Introduced extensions for responsive values (`rh`, `rw`, `rs`) to calculate height, width, and shortest side percentages with ease.
    - Example: `50.rh` â†’ 50% of screen height, `30.rw` â†’ 30% of screen width.
- **Improved Padding and Margins**:
  - Standardized dynamic padding (`defaultPadding`, `verticalPadding`, `horizontalPadding`) and margin helpers (`marginXS`, `marginS`, etc.).
- **Global Responsiveness**:
  - All sizes and styles now scale uniformly with a customizable `scale` factor.

### ðŸ”§ Fixes
- Fixed issues with scaling for smaller devices.
- Resolved padding inconsistencies in portrait and landscape orientations.
